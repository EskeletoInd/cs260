    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>
      Each player starts with 25,000 points.
      Each player creates a wall of 17x2 tiles.
      These walls become the draw pile.
      The dealer will then roll the dice to decide where to split the wall.
      The 7x2 Tiles to the left of the split becomes the dead wall.
      After the wall break, players take turns drawing tiles until they have 13 tiles.
      These are the players starting hands.
      The game begins on the dealer's turn.
